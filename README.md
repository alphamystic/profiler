# profiler

Profiler is a project for profiling the different threats that occur within a network or infrastructure just to take account or also profile the users in your network and find a base line for each determining what is normal and what is not.
However it does other stuff like generating,analyzing and storage of Yara rules and anything detection engineering.

Anyway I am just using this for my #100DaysOfYara
